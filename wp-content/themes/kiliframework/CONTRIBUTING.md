# How to contribute

Kili Framework is open source, and we would love to read your ideas about improvements for making it even more awesome.
If you want to contribute, please ensure you follow the guidelines below :)

## Contributing to Core

### Reporting Issues

This is a great way to became a contributor as it doesn't require technical skills. If you spot a bug, or want to help to solve one, you can go to [issues](https://github.com/koombea/kiliframework/issues/) and see what issues are open or create a new one.

### Making Changes

1. Fork the project (<https://github.com/koombea/kiliframework>).
    1. If you already forked the project, rebase your develop branch (`git pull --rebase git@github.com:koombea/kiliframework.git develop`)
    2. Ensure you follow the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/)
    3. Optionally it is recommended to install [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) on your editor to auto configure with indentation, line endings and other settings
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/fooBar`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some fooBar'`)
    1. When committing, reference your issue number (fix #1234)
4. Rebase your branch with the develop branch to ensure you have the latest version (`git pull --rebase develop`)
5. Push your branch (`git push origin feature/fooBar`)
6. Create a new Pull Request
