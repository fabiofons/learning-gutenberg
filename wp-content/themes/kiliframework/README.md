A fresh framework for developing themes in Wordpress.

Kili is a framework aimed to develop customized themes on WordPress. Our team has worked over the years to bring this idea to life and we are finally ready to release an Open Source GNU GPL V3 version of this framework.

Cleaner code. Thanks to the use of the Model Vista Controller (MVC), we can separate the data and business logic from the user interface. This way, the view wonâ€™t include php code that could be used for malicious attacks, and the development process is more pleasant.

It also brings more flexibility to the table by separating changes to the view from the business logic and by not requiring php knowledge. The view only contains front-end code (html, css, javascript), which makes it easier to maintain.

## How does it work?

* Focuses on agile and scalable development.
* Based on an MVC pattern.
* Separates PHP code from the view, allowing for a more readable process to add new blocks.
* Separates the views in reusable blocks.
* Retina ready.
* SEO optimized.
* Page builder through reusable blocks that can be adjusted to fit your needs.
* Intuitive content editor interface.
* Theme Child Support
* Theme Customizer Live preview
* Multi-languages support.

## Installation

Kili shares the same server requirements as a regular WordPress installation. [See requirements](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/).

Install Kili as you would a regular WordPress theme. See the [WordPress Theme Installation Guide](http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-install-a-wordpress-theme/).

Once installed, a couple of plugins are required:

* [Advanced Custom Fields](https://github.com/AdvancedCustomFields/acf)
* [Timber](https://github.com/timber/timber)

See the [WordPress Plugin Installation Guide](http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/).
